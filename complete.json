It handles requests for user profiles, suggested users, following/unfollowing users, and updating user information.\n\n2.  **Functions:**\n\n    *   **`router`:** (Implicitly defined by `express.Router()`) - This is an Express router object. It doesn't have explicit parameters or return values, but it's used to define routes. It's called implicitly when the routes are accessed.\n    *   **`protectRoute`:** (Middleware) - This function is imported from `../middlewares/protectRoute.js`. It takes `req, res, next` as parameters (implicitly, as middleware), and it doesn't have an explicit return value. It's called before each route handler to protect the route.\n    *   **`getUserProfile`:** (Controller function) - This function is imported from `../controllers/user.controller.js`. It takes `req, res` as parameters, and it doesn't have an explicit return value. It's called when a GET request is made to `/profile/:username`.\n    *   **`getSuggestedUser`:** (Controller function) - This function is imported from `../controllers/user.controller.js`. It takes `req, res` as parameters, and it doesn't have an explicit return value. It's called when a POST request is made to `/suggested`.\n    *   **`followUnfollowUser`:** (Controller function) - This function is imported from `../controllers/user.controller.js`. It takes `req, res` as parameters, and it doesn't have an explicit return value. It's called when a POST request is made to `/follow/:id`.\n    *   **`updateUser`:** (Controller function) - This function is imported from `../controllers/user.controller.js`. It takes `req, res` as parameters, and it doesn't have an explicit return value. It's called when a POST request is made to `/update`.\n\n3.  **External dependencies and tools used:**\n\n    *   `express`: A web application framework for Node.js.\n    *   `../middlewares/protectRoute.js`: A middleware module, likely used for authentication or authorization.\n    *   `../controllers/user.controller.js`: A module containing the controller functions for handling user-related logic.\n\n4.  **Related functions or endpoints it interacts with:**\n\n    *   The code defines the following API endpoints:\n        *   `/profile/:username` (GET): Retrieves a user's profile.\n        *   `/suggested` (POST): Retrieves suggested users.\n        *   `/follow/:id` (POST): Follows or unfollows a user.\n        *   `/update` (POST): Updates user information.\n    *   It interacts with the `protectRoute` middleware to secure these endpoints.\n    *   It interacts with the controller functions (`getUserProfile`, `getSuggestedUser`, `followUnfollowUser`, `updateUser`) to handle the actual logic of each endpoint.\n"

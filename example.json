    "analysis": "Here's a breakdown of the Python code provided, \"agent.py\":\n\n**1. Main Purpose and Functionality**\n\nThe primary purpose of this code is to create a flight search agent. It takes a user query as input, uses a Large Language Model (LLM) (specifically Google's Gemini-pro) to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information (like origin, destination, and departure date), and then uses this information to call a flight search API. The agent then returns the results from the API call. It uses LangGraph to orchestrate the flow of information and actions.\n\n**2. Key Functions and Their Roles**\n\n*   **`parse_user_query(input_data)`:**\n    *   **Role:** This function is the core of the intent recognition and data extraction process.\n    *   **Functionality:**\n        1.  It receives a dictionary `input_data` containing the user's query (under the key \"query\").\n        2.  It constructs a prompt for the Gemini LLM. This prompt instructs the LLM to:\n            *   Analyze the user's query.\n            *   Determine the user's *intent* (e.g., \"search\\_flights\").\n            *   Extract relevant details (e.g., origin, destination, departure date) from the query.\n            *   Format the extracted information as a JSON object.\n            *   If the intent is unclear, it should return a JSON object with \"intent\": \"unknown\".\n        3.  It calls the Gemini model (`model.generate_content(prompt)`) to get the LLM's response.\n        4.  It attempts to parse the LLM's response (which should be a JSON string) into a Python dictionary using `json.loads()`.\n        5.  It includes error handling: if the JSON parsing fails (e.g., the LLM returns invalid JSON), it sets the intent to \"unknown\".\n        6.  It prints the extracted data (for debugging/logging).\n        7.  It returns the extracted data (a dictionary).\n\n*   **`search_flights(input_data)`:**\n    *   **Role:** This function is responsible for calling the flight search API if the user's intent is to search for flights.\n    *   **Functionality:**\n        1.  It receives a dictionary `input_data` (likely the output of `parse_user_query`).\n        2.  It checks if the `input_data[\"intent\"]` is equal to \"search\\_flights\".\n        3.  If the intent is \"search\\_flights\", it calls the `search_flight_api()` function (imported from `api_calls.py`) with the origin, destination, and departure date extracted from the `input_data`.\n        4.  It constructs a dictionary `result` containing the type of the result (\"search\") and the result from the API call.\n        5.  It prints messages to confirm the flow of execution and data return.\n        6.  It returns the `result` dictionary.\n\n**3. Important Data Structures**\n\n*   **`input_data` (dictionaries):** This is the primary data structure used to pass information between functions. It typically contains:\n    *   The user's query (e.g., `{\"query\": \"flights from London to Paris tomorrow\"}`).\n    *   The extracted intent and details (e.g., `{\"intent\": \"search_flights\", \"origin\": \"LHR\", \"destination\": \"CDG\", \"departure_date\": \"2024-12-26\"}`).\n*   **JSON objects (strings and dictionaries):** Used for communication with the Gemini model and for structuring the extracted data.\n*   **`graph` (LangGraph object):** This is the core of the agent's workflow. It defines the nodes (functions) and edges (connections) that determine the order in which actions are executed.\n\n**4. External Dependencies**\n\n*   **`google.generativeai`:** This library is used to interact with Google's Gemini LLM.  It's used for the `genai.configure()` and `GenerativeModel()` calls.\n*   **`langgraph`:** This library is used to build the agent's workflow as a directed graph. It provides the `Graph` class and methods for adding nodes, edges, and setting entry/finish points.\n*   **`json`:** This built-in Python library is used for encoding and decoding JSON data (converting between Python dictionaries and JSON strings).\n*   **`os`:** This built-in Python library is used to access environment variables (e.g., to retrieve the API key).\n*   **`api_calls` (custom module):** This is a custom module (presumably in a file named `api_calls.py`) that contains the `search_flight_api()` function. This function is responsible for making the actual API call to a flight search service (e.g., Amadeus, Sabre).  The code assumes this module is in the same directory.\n\n**5. How it Interacts with Other Parts of the System**\n\n*   **Input:** The agent receives a user query as input, likely from another part of the system (e.g., a chatbot, a web interface, or another service). The input is passed to the `parse_user_query` function.\n*   **Gemini LLM:** The `parse_user_query` function interacts with the Gemini LLM to understand the user's intent and extract relevant information.\n*   **Flight Search API:** The `search_flights` function calls the `search_flight_api()` function (from the `api_calls` module) to interact with a flight search service. This API call is where the actual flight search happens.\n*   **Output:** The agent returns the results from the flight search API (or an \"unknown\" intent if it can't understand the query). This output is then likely passed back to the user or another part of the system.\n*   **LangGraph:** LangGraph orchestrates the flow of data and control between the functions. It ensures that `parse_user_query` is executed first, and then `search_flights` is executed if the intent is \"search\\_flights\". The `graph.compile()` call creates an executable agent from the defined graph.\n\nIn summary, this code defines a flight search agent that uses an LLM to understand user queries, extracts relevant information, and then uses that information to call a flight search API. The agent's workflow is managed by LangGraph, which allows for a structured and modular approach to building the agent.\n"
